# Example Cloud Configs

The examples in this directory
are not under continuous test,
and may not be up to date.

They are intended to be a useful starting place.
For more information about
cf-deployment's use of cloud configs,
please see [On Cloud Configs](../../texts/on-cloud-configs.md)
in the texts directory.

The examples are variablized.
You may be able to use them unmodified
(beyond filling in the appropriate vars)
with `bosh update-cloud-config <cloud config template> -l <cloud config vars file>`.
